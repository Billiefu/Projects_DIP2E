### Description

To address the requirements for course-related lab reports, the format recommendations have been consolidated and improved. To ensure convenience for instructors or teaching assistants when grading lab reports for relevant courses, these recommendations are continued here. It is advised that lab reports be kept as concise as possible, with the experimental content written in clear and straightforward language. Below is the suggested format for lab reports. Additionally, for the lab report format mentioned below, Word and LaTeX templates will be provided for those who need them.

#### Cover Page

The title page should include the basic information of the project, mainly including:

* Project title
* Project number
* Course number
* Student's name
* Date due
* Date handed in

The title page should start on a separate page. If the project report is written in plain text editing, such as `Markdown` format, creating a separate title page may be difficult. In this case, it is suggested to omit the title page and instead use the title as a substitute, but still retain the basic information such as the project title, project number, and student's name.

#### Abstract

The abstract should briefly summarize the content of the entire article, emphasizing the purpose of the project, the process of the project's execution, and the conclusions drawn from the project. The abstract should consist solely of ext and should not include any images or formulas. Additionally, the abstract should not be too long, ideally not exceeding half a page. After writing the abstract, keywords related to the project report should be written below the abstract section.

#### Body Text

The main body should include the following part:

* A description of the project's problem
* A theoretical explanation of the methods used to solve the problem
* Experiments conducted on the problem along with the analysis of their results
* A conclusive summary of the project.

If the project is a group project, the division of tasks among group members should be clarified after describing the project.

If the experiment, based on textbook examples, yields unsatisfactory results (a common occurrence), an optimization discussion should be included to address this issue. The optimization discussion should be presented before the results analysis section to allow for comparative analysis during the results discussion.

The emphasis should be placed on describing the experimental methods and analyzing the results, while the project description and the conclusive summary should not be overly detailed. If there are numerous experimental results, they can be placed in a separate appendix, but a reference to the appendix should be made in the main text.

#### Appendix

The appendix section is not mandatory and should be added as needed based on individual requirements. The following items can be considered for inclusion in the appendix:

* Project list
* Project code
* Result images and lists
* Acknowledgments
* References

It is recommended to submit the project code as a separate attachment rather than including it in the appendix. Additionally, references should be written in accordance with the GB/T 7714 format.
