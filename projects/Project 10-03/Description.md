### Question

(a) Implement the optimum thresholding approach discussed in Section 10.3-5. Assume Gaussian densities in which the variances of the objects and background are the same. In addition to an image, the inputs to your program are as shown in Eq. (10.3-14).

(b) Write a program that, given an image patch, computes the mean and variance of the pixels in the patch.

(c) Download Fig. 10.27(a) and select a small patch in the region of the object and also of the background to estimate the mean and variance of each. Compute the value of a single variance by averaging the two variances just obtained. Obtain the probabilities P1 and P2 by estimating (manually) the relative areas occupied by the object and background. Input the parameters thus obtained into your program and segment Fig. 10.27(a). If you were assigned Project 10-02 as well, compare the results.
