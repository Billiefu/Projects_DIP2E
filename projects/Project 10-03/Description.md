### Question

(a) Implement the optimum thresholding approach discussed in Section 10.3-5. Assume Gaussian densities in which the variances of the objects and background are the same. In addition to an image, the inputs to your program are as shown at $T=\frac{\mu_1+\mu_2}{2}+\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu_1-\mu_2}\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1})$.

(b) Write a program that, given an image patch, computes the mean and variance of the pixels in the patch.

(c) Download `original_septagon.bmp` and select a small patch in the region of the object and also of the background to estimate the mean and variance of each. Compute the value of a single variance by averaging the two variances just obtained. Obtain the probabilities $P_1$ and $P_2$ by estimating (manually) the relative areas occupied by the object and background. Input the parameters thus obtained into your program and segment `kidney_original.bmp`. If you were assigned Project 10-02 as well, compare the results.
