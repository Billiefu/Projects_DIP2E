### Question

This is a generic project, in the sense that the programs developed here are used in several of the projects that follow. See Fig. 5.2 for the shapes and parameters of the following noise probability density functions.

(a) Find (or develop) a program to add Gaussian noise to an image. You must be able to specify the noise mean and variance.

(b) Find (or develop) a program to add salt-and-pepper (impulse) noise to an image. You must be able to specify the probabilities of each of the two noise components.
