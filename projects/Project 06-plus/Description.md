### Question

Facial detection, a key research area in computer vision, has extensive practical applications in fields such as identity verification, public safety, and smart interaction. Early methods for facial detection were primarily based on color space modeling and structural feature analysis. From approximately 1990 to 2010, color space-based facial detection was highly prevalent in the image processing community. Recently, researchers have also been exploring color space-based facial detection frameworks for more challenging scenarios, including those with severe occlusion and unconstrained environments.

In this project, you are tasked with designing a color space-based facial detection framework, applying it to a real-world facial detection environment, and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of your designed framework based on the experimental results.
