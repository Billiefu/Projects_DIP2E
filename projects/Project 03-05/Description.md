### Question

(a) Use the programs developed in Projects 03-03 and 03-04 to implement theLaplacian enhancement technique described in connection with the equation below. Use the mask shown in Fig. 3.39(d).

$$
g(x,y)=\begin{cases} f(x,y)-\nabla^2f(x,y),\quad \text{if the Laplace mask has a negative central coefficient} \\ f(x,y)+\nabla^2f(x,y),\quad \text{if the Laplace mask has a positive central coefficient} \end{cases}
$$

(b) Duplicate the results in Fig. 3.40. You will need to download `blurry-moon.bmp`.
