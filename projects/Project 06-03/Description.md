### Question

(a) Download `bottom_left_stream.bmp`. Convert the image to RGB (see comments at the beginning of Project 06-01). Histogram-equalize the R, G, and B images separately using the histogram-equalization program and convert the image back to jpg format.

(b) Form an average histogram from the three histograms in (a) and use it as the basis to obtain a single histogram equalization intensity transformation function. Apply this function to the R, G, and B components individually, and convert the results to jpg. Compare and explain the differences in the jpg images in (a) and (b).
