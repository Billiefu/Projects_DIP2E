### Question

(a) Extend the program from `Project 03-04` to compute the Sobel gradient using the masks in Fig. 10.8. Your program should implement $\nabla f \approx \left| G_x \right| + \left| G_y \right|$, and have the option of outputting a binary image by comparing each gradient point against a specified threshold, $T$.

(b) Download `kidney_original.bmp`. By combining smoothing with a $3\times3$ mask from `Project 03-04` and your program from (a), process Fig. 10.15(a) and produce a binary image that isolates (segments) the large blood vessel in the center of the image. This will require repeated trials of smoothing and choices of $T$. Looking at the histogram (`Project 03-02`) of the gradient image before it is thresholded will help you select a value for $T$.
