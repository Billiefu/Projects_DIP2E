### Question

Write program to perform spatial filtering of an image (see Section 3.5 regarding implementation). You can fix the size of the spatial mask at $3 \times 3$, but the coefficients need to be variables that can be input into your program. This project is generic, in the sense that it will be used in other projects to follow.
