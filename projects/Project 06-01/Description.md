### Question

In order to complete this project, it is necessary that you find a program capable of generating the RGB component images for a given jpg color image. For example, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox can do this, but you can also do it with image editing programs like Adobe's Photo-Shop or Corel's Photo-Paint. It is acceptable for the purposes of this project to convert an image to RGB (and back) manually.

(a) Write a computer program that converts an arbitrary RGB color image to a web-safe RGB image (see Fig. 6.10 for a definition of web-safe colors).

(b) Download the image in Fig. 6.8 and convert it to a web-safe RGB color image. Figure 6.8 is given in jpg format, so convert your result back to jpg (see comments at the beginning of this project). Explain the differences between your result and Fig. 6.8.
