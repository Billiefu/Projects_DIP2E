### Question

(a) Write a program that implements sinusoidal noise of the form given in Problem 5.14. The inputs to the program must be the amplitude, $A$, and the two frequency components $u_0$ and $v_0$ shown in the problem equation.

(b) Download `DIP.bmp` and add sinusoidal noise to it, with $u_0 = M/2$ (the image is square) and $v_0 = 0$. The value of A must be high enough for the noise to be quite visible in the image.

(c) Compute and display the spectrum of the image. If the FFT program you developed in Project 4.01 can only handle images of size equal to an integer power of 2, reduce the size of the image to $512 \times 512$ or $256 \times 256$ using the program from Project 02-04. Resize the image before adding noise to it.

(d) Notch-filter the image using a notch filter of the form shown in Fig. 5.19(c).
