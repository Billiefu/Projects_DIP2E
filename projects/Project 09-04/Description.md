### Question

Use previous results plus any new required techniques and write a computer program to completely solve Problem 9.27. Solve the problem.

**Problem 9.27**

A crucial pretreatment step in microscopy applications involves isolating individual particles from clusters of overlapping particles. Assuming all particles are uniform in size, a morphological algorithm generates three distinct images:

(a) particles that are exclusively fused with image boundaries.

(b) Overlapping particles.

(c) Non-overlapping particles.
