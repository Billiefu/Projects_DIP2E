### Question

(a) Implement the Gaussian lowpass filter in $H(u,v)=e^{-D^2(u,v)/2\sigma^2}$. You must be able to specify the size, $M \times N$, of the resulting 2D function. In addition, you must be able to specify where the 2D location of the center of the Gaussian function.

(b) Download `testpattern1024.bmp` and lowpass filter it to obtain Fig. 4.18(c).
