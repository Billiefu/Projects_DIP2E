### Question

(a) Implement the Gaussian lowpass filter in Eq. (4.3-7). You must be able to specify the size, $M \times N$, of the resulting 2D function. In addition, you must be able to specify where the 2D location of the center of the Gaussian function.

(b) Download Fig. 4.11(a) (this image is the same as Fig. 4.18(a)) and lowpass filter it to obtain Fig. 4.18(c).
