### Question

(a) Implement the Fourier descriptor scheme developed in Section 11.2.3.

(b) Download `airplanes1.bmp` and `airplanes2.bmp` and obtain the boundaries of each using your program from Project 09-02. Choose 256 points to represent each boundary. The 256 points should be as equally-spaced as reasonably possible.

(c) Obtain the Fourier descriptors of each figure (be sure to start at approximately the same point in each figure). Approximate the boundaries using the first 16, 32, 64 and 128 of the coefficients (see Example 11.3 for guidance). Plot each result.
