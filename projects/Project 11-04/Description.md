### Question

(a) Implement the principal components transform discussed in Section 11.4. The objective is to be able to use Eqs. (11.4-11) and (11.4.-12). You will need routines to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

(b) Download `WashingtonDCBand1.bmp` through `WashingtonDCBand6.bmp` and duplicate the sequence of operations described in Example 11.10, including the images and tables. It is not necessary to duplicate Fig. 11.27.
