### Question

(a) Subtract your image in Project 04-03(b) from the original to obtain a sharpened image, as in Eq. (4.4-14). You will note that the resulting image does not resemble the Gaussian highpass results in Fig. 4.26. Explain why this is so.

(b) Adjust the variance of your Gaussian lowpass filter until the result obtained by image subtraction looks similar to Fig. 4.26(c). Explain your result.
